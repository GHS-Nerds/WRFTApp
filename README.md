# WRFTApp 0.1.0
----------
##Aims:

###This project is an app for the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust. It will:

  * Provide casual anglers with databases of Fish species, Insect life, Local Geology and good fishing locations,

  * Allow anglers to fill in data about their catches,

  * And relay this data to the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust Database
  
  * All inside the Wester Ross Area

##Specifications:

  * We are using [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) for design tasks.
  
  * The data the anglers enter will be emailed to the server.
   *(Security could be improved by the use of GPG end-to-end encryption in the future)*
